# mobx-state-tree typescript slowness & duplications in `d.ts` emit (And how to make it better) [part 1]

`mobx-state-tree` is an interesting creation that takes types to a new level and typescript inference power to it's limits.  
It's doing so by defining runtime models and types in code, and inferring design-time typescript informatio.
On this series of articles, we will learn about some caveats and how to overcome them.



## The problem(s)
Emitting typescript types for naive `MST` code, that uses any form of compositing,
will lead to duplication/inline of the entire tree of model types on each reference point.

Example:
```ts
export const Store1 = t
    .model('Store1', {
        store2: t.optional(t.array(Store2), [])
    });
```
<sub>based on https://github.com/garygentry/mst-decl-test/blob/master/src/stores/store1.ts</sub>

Will emit:

```ts
export declare const Store1: import("mobx-state-tree").IModelType<{
    store2: import("mobx-state-tree").IOptionalIType<import("mobx-state-tree").IArrayType<import("mobx-state-tree").IModelType<{
        store3: import("mobx-state-tree").IArrayType<import("mobx-state-tree").IModelType<{
            store4: import("mobx-state-tree").IModelType<{
                store5: import("mobx-state-tree").IModelType<{
                    prop1: import("mobx-state-tree").IMaybe<import("mobx-state-tree").ISimpleType<string>>;
                }, {}, import("mobx-state-tree")._NotCustomized, import("mobx-state-tree")._NotCustomized>;
            }, {}, import("mobx-state-tree")._NotCustomized, import("mobx-state-tree")._NotCustomized>;
            store5: import("mobx-state-tree").IOptionalIType<import("mobx-state-tree").IModelType<{
                prop1: import("mobx-state-tree").IMaybe<import("mobx-state-tree").ISimpleType<string>>;
            }, {}, import("mobx-state-tree")._NotCustomized, import("mobx-state-tree")._NotCustomized>, [undefined]>;
        }, {}, import("mobx-state-tree")._NotCustomized, import("mobx-state-tree")._NotCustomized>>;
    }, {}, import("mobx-state-tree")._NotCustomized, import("mobx-state-tree")._NotCustomized>>, [undefined]>;
}, {}, import("mobx-state-tree")._NotCustomized, import("mobx-state-tree")._NotCustomized>;
```
What we can see here is that instead of referencing types of the child models, we get full duplication/inlining of child models declarations.
That happens for each level inside the stores tree will have the same duplication up to it's level.


## ...But it's not impact only types emit!

You can think of types emit as visualization of the inferred data structures inside typescript language server. duplication in `d.ts` = more work `tsc/tsserver` need to do or regular basis.  
And indeed when working with big and nested models, the build time and IDE responsiveness of typescript types is badly degraded

## Peeling the onion ðŸ§…

On the coming articles, we will cover issues with `MST` and workarounds for them, one by one, like peeling a fire roasted onion to get to the tasty parts!

## Layer one: reduce import() references
When examining the emitted types for `Store1` above, the first thing that catches my eye is the many references to `import("mobx-state-tree")` for the same symbol. 
`import("mobx-state-tree").IModelType` appears 5 times!

What can we do about it? Lets import the types directly!  
Adding `import type * as MST from "mobx-state-tree";` to our model file will turn the emitted types into:
```ts
import type * as MST from "mobx-state-tree";
export declare const Store1: MST.IModelType<{
    store2: MST.IOptionalIType<MST.IArrayType<MST.IModelType<{
        store3: MST.IArrayType<MST.IModelType<{
            store4: MST.IModelType<{
                store5: MST.IModelType<{
                    prop1: MST.IMaybe<MST.ISimpleType<string>>;
                }, {}, MST._NotCustomized, MST._NotCustomized>;
            }, {}, MST._NotCustomized, MST._NotCustomized>;
            store5: MST.IOptionalIType<MST.IModelType<{
                prop1: MST.IMaybe<MST.ISimpleType<string>>;
            }, {}, MST._NotCustomized, MST._NotCustomized>, [undefined]>;
        }, {}, MST._NotCustomized, MST._NotCustomized>>;
    }, {}, MST._NotCustomized, MST._NotCustomized>>, [undefined]>;
}, {}, MST._NotCustomized, MST._NotCustomized>;

```

Much more compact and readable!  
You may also import individual symbols instead of a star import

## Layer two: Child stores inlining

The second thing that catches the eye is that, even thu `Store2` (And the rest) are declared on a separate file, we ended up with the entire stores types inline inside `Store1`.

Let's understand why that's happing:
When typescript does not have a clear name for type information, it will be inlined into his reference points!  
MST `models` and `types` are not TypeScript type information, but actual javascript values, that typescript infers type information from, and creates ephemeral interfaces/types without a name.

### How can we name inferred, "ephemeral" types?

We will create an interface out of inferred type information, and mask the original model with it!

Before, "bad" example:
{% gist https://gist.github.com/Bnaya/5c208956a3e5f3699595f9b9ca0ad3eb file=bad.ts %}

Will emit:
{% gist https://gist.github.com/Bnaya/5c208956a3e5f3699595f9b9ca0ad3eb file=bad.d.ts %}


After, good example:
{% gist https://gist.github.com/Bnaya/5c208956a3e5f3699595f9b9ca0ad3eb file=good.ts %}

Will emit:
{% gist https://gist.github.com/Bnaya/5c208956a3e5f3699595f9b9ca0ad3eb file=good.d.ts %}

Examining Model B types,
```ts
declare const ModelBInferred: IModelType<{
    /**
     * No Duplication here, but a reference to ModelAFactoryType
     */
    a: ModelAFactoryType;
}, {}, _NotCustomized, _NotCustomized>;
```
We can see that Model A is no longer inlined, but the there's a reference to the interface we've created.

## Recap, downsides and tips 

This way of writing MST models is very verbose, and add additional indirections, which is not fun.
You may selectively apply that on some of your models.  
It's highly recommended to have a clear naming convention for the inferred symbols, and the public symbols.  
These patterns are not applicable only for models, but for every MST complex type. 


### Thank you for reading, your feedback is very welcome!

## Coming up next in part 2:

On part 2 we will analyze why MST union still cause duplications, and how we can overcome them.
